# FNAF-Security-Breach-No-STAFF-Bots-Mod
This is a mod that removes functionality of the STAFF Bots within the game of FNAF Security Breach. It also retextures several assets because I got bored.

Prerequisites:
  -Unreal Mod Unlocker: https://illusory.dev/ (Without this, the modded files will not be used)
   Generalized Tutorial on Unreal Mod Unlocker: https://youtu.be/ZZrEZMi6X5o?t=62 (Use FNAF SB file path instead)
 
Installation:
  Copy all folders to "[Steam Library]\steamapps\common\Quarters\fnaf9\Content";
  Install "Unreal Mod Unlocker" to "[Steam Library]\steamapps\common\Quarters\fnaf9\Binaries\Win64". You will have to launch the game once for the Mod Unlocker to initialize before the game will run.
